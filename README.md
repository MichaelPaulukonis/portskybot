# portskybot
The sky over the port was the color of a twitter-bot, tuned to pos-tagged template.

A (heroku) NodeJs Twitter-bot generating endless variations on the first sentence of William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk novel, _Neuromancer_.

portskybot takes the first sentence as  a part-of-speech (pos) tagged template and renders it with words replaced by other words, of the same part-of-speech as found in neuromancer.

The original sentence can theorhetically be recreated, but tests on a couple million sentences have not done so, yet. Somebody with more time, or more math, than me could figure out the statistics for this...
